[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/angelrenegarcia13/DominicanWhoCodes/_apis/build/status/AngelGarcia13.DominicanWhoCodes?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/angelrenegarcia13/DominicanWhoCodes/_build/latest?definitionId=4&branchName=master)

Open source project inspired in http://indianswhodesign.in, made to expose all the developers from the Dominican Republic with their skills and contacts. 

The idea is to have this directoy where you could find the Dominicans devs info, this project is basically for me and @ManuHernandez (and everybody who want to collaborate) to learn/use some of the main JS front-end frameworks (Angular, Vue and React), play with some WebAssembly technologies like Blazor and also implement a Microservices Architecture.

See the [Roadmap](Roadmap.md) for more technical details.

### Flutter Client App.
Download it, run the command 'flutter run' and test it, Lol, maybe someday will be on playstore :D

### Knowed Issues
###### *Decoding the Json data, it's not working with UTF8, so, the especial characters are crashing
###### *If Name it's big, it said an error for not enought pixels or something like that
###### *The externals links to github, webpage and so on, need to be placed on a row, not as column, but, it's giving an error than crash all the app if I made it in that way.
###### *The app need to load the data by part, because in that way the app looks too slow.
